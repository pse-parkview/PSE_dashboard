\section{Scenarios}

\scenario{Inspecting Last Change}{scn:inspect_last_change}
{Ted: \Gls{user}, CI: \Gls{benchmarking system}}
{Ted works on a project that has \emph{PROJECT NAME} set up. He makes changes on a performance critical component. After that he pushes his changes to the repository. The CI sends its benchmark results to the system, which stores it in a persistent way. Ted opens the webapp and selects a benchmark. He sees a list of all recent changes. The changes without benchmark data are greyed out. Ted selects his newest change. He selects a device to take the benchmark data from. The change appears in a list of selected changes. Ted selects the \enquote{Create New Plot} option. A popup appears. Ted chooses the dimension he wants to inspect. After he configured his plot he decides to save the \gls{template} for later use. He selects the \enquote{Save Template} option. He enters a name for the \gls{template} and selects the \enquote{Save} option. After that he selects the \enquote{Generate Plot} option. Ted gets redirected to a new site where he can inspect his plot. He decides to send this plot to a coworker. He selects the \enquote{Share} option and a link gets displayed. He copies the link and sends it to his coworker.}

\scenario{Comparing Benchmarks}{scn:comp_benchmarks}
{Greta: \Gls{user}}
{Greta opens the webapp. She selects a benchmark. She selects two benchmarks by first picking a specific change and then a specific device. She opens the configuration popup by selecting the \enquote{Create New Plot} option. She wants to use a previously created \gls{template}. She selects the \enquote{Use Template} option and chooses her \gls{template} from a list of available ones. The settings specified in the \gls{template} get applied to the current \gls{configuration}. Greta makes final adjustments and then selects the \enquote{Generate Plot} option. After that she gets redirected to a new site where she can inspect her plot. Ted also wants to download the plot for use in his publication. He selects the \enquote{Export} option. He gets to choose between a seleciton of filetypes. He picks his preferred one. A link gets displayed leading to a download with the selected filetype.}

\scenario{Performance Tracking}{scn:perf_tracking}
{CI: \Gls{benchmarking system}}
{The CI runs a specific benchmark for a specific change on a specific device. It sends a POST request to the system containing the results and the benchmark type, change identification and device name. The system receives the results and stores them in a persistent database. It recognizes that the benchmark performance has dropped by a significant factor. The system triggers a hook that sends a message to the developer slack channel informing about the performance drop. It also publishes a comment under the change on GitHub.}
