\section{Introduction}

[PLACEHOLDER] Since the dawn of humanity, humans asked themselves: What is the fastest way to solve a system of linear equations? What is the most memory efficient one? Under a giant ginko tree, they didn't find the answer but only another question: How do you actually compare two ways to solve a system of linear equations? Since then human development rapidly accelerated towards its own demise, but not without finding the answer to the tree's question: \emph{graphs, a big bunch of graphs}. To finally end this millennia old search this project was conceived. It has a simple task: generate a bunch of graphs in all shapes and colors. With its completion humanity might get one step closer to finally finding the one and only way to solve a system of linear equations. But in the shadows still lurks the old enemy of the ginko tree: THE BRACHIOSAURUS. It will devour any systems of linear equations it may find, destroying the homework of hundreds of middle school students and nobody will ever believe them that a dinosaur ate their homework. The only way to stop the brachiosaurus is to eat him, but nobody dares eating a whole dinosaur, especially not in one sitting. And because of the humongous size there is no way to fit it in any fridge. Do you want to let food spoil? I don't. So the brachiosaurus rages one, destroying the dreams of any person thinking he can find the best way to solve a system of linear equations. [PLACEHOLDER]
