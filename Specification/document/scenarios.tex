\section{Scenarios}

\scenario{Inspecting Last Commit}{scn:inspect-last-commit}
{Ted: \Gls{user}, CI: \Gls{benchmarking system}}
{Ted works on a project that has \parkview{} set up. He makes commits on a performance critical component. After that he pushes his commits to the repository. The CI sends its benchmark results to \parkview{}, which stores it in a persistent way. Ted opens the application and selects a benchmark. He sees a list of all recent commits. The commits without benchmark data are greyed out. Ted selects his newest commit. He selects the device the benchmark ran on. The commit appears in a list of selected commits. Ted selects the \enquote{Create New Plot} option. A popup appears. Ted chooses the dimension he wants to inspect. After that he selects the \enquote{Generate Plot} option. Ted gets redirected to a new site where he can inspect his plot.} 

\scenario{Comparing Benchmarks}{scn:comp-benchmarks}
{Greta: \Gls{user}}
{Greta opens \parkview{}. She selects a benchmark. She selects two benchmarks by first picking a specific commit and then a specific device. She opens the configuration popup by selecting the \enquote{Create New Plot} option. Greta makes adjustments to the \gls{configuration} and then selects the \enquote{Generate Plot} option. After that she gets redirected to a new site where she can inspect her plot.}

\scenario{Exporting a plot}{scn:export}
{Richard: \Gls{user}}
{Richard needs a \gls{plot} of the his projects performance for a publication. He opens \parkview{} and creates the plot that he needs. He selects the \emph{Export} option. A link for gets displayed which leads to a download for his plot.}

\scenario{Sharing a plot}{scn:share}
{Willhelm: \Gls{user}}
{Willhelm needs a \gls{plot} of the his projects performance for a publication. He opens \parkview{} and creates the plot that he needs. He selects the \emph{Export} option. A link gets displayed which leads to a download for his plot.}

\scenario{Usage of templates}{scn:template}
{Elizabeth: \Gls{user}}
{Elizabeth opens the application. She selects a set of \glspl{benchmark configuration} for specifc commits and starts creating a \gls{plot}. After she finished configuring her \gls{plot} she decides to keep the \gls{configuration} for later use. She selects the \emph{Save Template} option. Elizabeth enters a template name. She downloads her template as a \gls{json} file. Later she wants to reproduce the \gls{plot}. In the configuration panel she selects the \emph{Load Template}. She sees a list of previously created templates and an option to upload a tempalte from a \gls{json} file. She selects the \emph{Upload From File} option and selects her previously downloaded \gls{template}. The templates settings get applied to the open \gls{configuration}.}

\scenario{Performance Tracking}{scn:perf-tracking}
{CI: \Gls{benchmarking system}}
{The CI runs a specific benchmark for a specific commit on a specific device. It sends a POST request to \parkview{} containing the results and the benchmark type, commit identification and device name. \parkview{} receives the results and stores them in a persistent database. It recognizes that the benchmark performance has dropped by a significant factor. \parkview{} triggers a hook that sends a message to the developer slack channel informing about the performance drop. It also publishes a comment under the commit on GitHub.}

\scenario{Benchmark Post Failure}{scn:post-data-failure}
{CI: \Gls{benchmarking system}}
{The CI runs a specific benchmark fo a specific commit on a specific device. It fails to correctly format the data. It sends a POST request containing the malformed data to \parkview{}. \parkview{} takes the data and detects that it is wrongly formatted. \parkview{} responds to the CI with the corresponding error code.}

\scenario{Benchmark Fetch Failure}{scn:fetch-data-failure}
{Jeff: \Gls{user}}
{Jeff opens the application. He wants to create a \gls{plot} from a specific benchmark result. He selects the benchmark result and configures the \gls{plot}. Jeff selects the \enquote{Generate Plot} option. \parkview{} realizes that the benchmark isn't available. It displays an error messsage to Jeff that explains the problem.}
