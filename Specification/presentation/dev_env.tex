    \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> Backend: Kotlin
                 %Because its like java, but being more concise and less error prone while also 
                 %offering the same advantages java has, e.g. java libraries like spring. 
        \item<+-> DBMS: PostgreSQL
                 %We would like to use a Relational data base because it will allow 
                 %easier comparison across different dimensions and their values
        \item<+-> Frontend: Angular
                 %Angulars component-based structure looks like a very suitable framework for the
                 %Website, since our draft(as seen in the mock up) is also built in a somewhat modular way.
        \item<+-> Modeling: PlantUML and Lucidchart
                 %Relevant for definition phase i think
        \item<+-> git and GitHub Actions
                 %Vcs and more vcs based error prevention and stuff
        \item<+-> Documentation: \LaTeX\
                 %Offering a documentation of the API, of how to use the webapp etc seems like a
                 %good idea
